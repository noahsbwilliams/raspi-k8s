# Raspberry Pi Kubernetes

Batteries-included, on-prem Kubernetes

Kubernetes was developed to be cloud-agnostic, but not environment-agnostic. In trying to spin up our own cluster on-prem, we discovered that basic functions like file storage weren't supported by default. Our intent with this project is to source all components necessary to build an on-prem cluster functionally equivalent to one you might find in a public cloud.

This repository contains:

1. The selection of software used for [Kubernetes](#kubernetes-distribution-), [storage](#storage-), [networking](#networking-), [secrets management](#secrets-management-), and a [GUI](#gui-).
2. The selection of [hardware](#hardware) used in the reference cluster.

## Software

### Kubernetes Distribution ✅

- [x] [K3s](https://k3s.io)
### Storage ✅

- [x] [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io)


### Networking ✅/❌

- [x] `autossh` hacked together reverse tunnel for now
- [ ] More permanent solution under exploration, undecided

### Secrets Management ❌

- [ ] [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) (HA mode) use intended
- [ ] Native Kubernetes [secrets encryption](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/) also a possibility

### GUI ❌

- [ ] [Rancher](https://rancher.com), a simple GUI for Kubernetes
  - [ ] Pending adoption until Rancher v2 supports Kubernetes v1.20
