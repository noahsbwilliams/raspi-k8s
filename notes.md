    - Supports both x86-64 and ARM64
  - [Ceph Setup Guide on Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIRMxl_oEMM)
    - Uses tool Rook which Kubernetifies Ceph
    - Includes simple means to specify which nodes are used for storage & what the mount path is on them
  - [Rook/Ceph yaml examples](https://github.com/rook/rook/tree/release-1.4/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph)
  - [Provisioning Ceph Block Storage](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.4/ceph-block.html)
